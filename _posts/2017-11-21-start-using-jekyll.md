I have tried a few blogging tools before. The oldest of those was on Microsoft (Live/MSN?) Space, which I started using from 2005 (phew, time flies). Others include some the Chinese blogging site [blog.sina.com.cn](http://blog.sina.com.cn), which I really like, and Baidu's old blogging site [hi Baidu](http://hi.baidu.com) (yes, it used to be a blogging site) and of course, WordPress. I even built my own blogging site using Django in 2015. Despite the fact that I really enjoy using them, especially MSN Space and the Sina blog, each of them has some sort of problem and over time I stopped using them.

Jekyll seems to fit right into my needs - it's simple to use, yet powerful enough to function as a blog like any other platforms. I also don't have to pay for high hosting fees like what happend when I built my own blogging app using Django. So I guess I will keep trying using it for some time. The only I am concerned right now is spell checking. It seems I cannot use the spell checking app I typically use (Grammarly) with the GitHub editor. My favorite editor (Vim) also doesn't seem to have spell check. Maybe with some searching I can find a solution for this.
